# CLCA on Debian Live (Live Root CA)
This directory contains the build environment for packaging CLCA
and assorted tools in a bootable Debian Live CD.

To build the image run ./build-iso.sh on a Debian system (requires
the live-build package).

## Base build
The base build contains the base tools clca (for CA operation) and
secret (for optional secret sharing).

## Build time customization

### Thales/nCipher nFast HSM support
NOTE: nCipher driver inclusion is not supported by clca Community Edition

The addon script addons.d/05-nfast.sh scans for the distribution files
of the Thales/nCipher nFast drivers in the directory ./contrib

If the addon detects a file with the file pattern

SecWorld*.iso

in the contrib directory, it will mount the iso file on a temporary
mount point and automatically include the nCipher drivers in this ISO
image in the generated ISO.

In addition, the default user is changed from "user" to "nfast" to
make HSM operations easier for the operator.

### Luna SA support
NOTE: Luna support is probably deprecated.

The addon script addons.d/50-luna-hsm.sh scans for SafeNet Luna HSM drivers
in the directory luna/ in this directory.
Place the contents of the directory luna_hsm/drivers/linux/64/ in this
directory.

Obtain the support file 
*OPENSSL_TOOLKIT_LunaSA_*.tar
and also copy it to this directory. As of this writing (2015-11-29)
this support document can be obtained from SafeNet via document ID DOW4073.


### Boot splash logo

If either contrib/splash.svg or contrib/splash.png exists, the respective
file is included as a splash logo image during the build process. The
image is displayed "full screen" as a background to boot option selection
menu.

## Persistence

Persistence is explained in sectioni 10.3 of the Debian Live manual.
See http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/live-manual/stable/manual/html/live-manual.en.html#556

In short:

- create a vfat partition on a different memory stick (or the same memory stick the Live CD is installed on)
- create a sparse file named persistence in the top directory of the vfat partition
- mkfs.ext4 -F persistence
- mount -t ext4 persistence /mnt
- echo "/home" >/mnt/persistence.conf
- umount /mnt


## Runtime customizing options

### Custom startup exection

If the user's (persistent) home directory contains an executable file
~/.rc.local it will be executed **as root** on startup.

### Custom background image

If the user's (persistent) home directory contains the file .xrootimage.png
it will be displayed on the background of the graphical environment.
